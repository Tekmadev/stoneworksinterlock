    question: "Do you provide free quotes?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We offer free, no-pressure quotes for all our services—from new installation to repairs, washing, and polymeric sand. You can call us or submit the quote form with a few details and, if you like, photos of the area. We’ll review everything and recommend next steps and a ballpark idea of cost. There’s no obligation to book.",
  },
  {
    question: "How soon can you start?",
    answer:
      "Start times depend on the season, our current schedule, and the scope of your project. Smaller jobs (e.g. washing, resanding) can often be scheduled within a few weeks; larger installations may be booked further out. When you reach out, we’ll give you a realistic timeline and keep communication clear so you know what to expect.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer interlock repairs and leveling?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We repair sunken or uneven pavers by re-leveling the surface, rebuilding weak base sections where needed, and restoring borders and joints. Whether it’s a few loose stones or a larger sunken area, we’ll assess the cause (often base or drainage) and fix it so the surface is stable and safe again.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you improve drainage and pooling water?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can improve drainage by adjusting grading, adding or tying into drains, and directing water away from the house and walkways. That reduces pooling, puddles, and ice buildup on the surface. We’ll look at your site and suggest the right approach—whether it’s regrading, channel drains, or other solutions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What areas do you service?",
    answer:
      "We service Ottawa and the surrounding areas, including nearby cities and towns in the region. If you’re unsure whether we cover your address, send your city or postal code (e.g. via the contact form or when you call), and we’ll confirm before you book.",
  },
  {
    question: "What warranty do you provide?",
    answer:
      "We stand behind our workmanship. Warranty terms depend on the scope of work and materials (e.g. new install vs repair). We’ll outline what’s covered and for how long in writing so you have it on file. If anything doesn’t meet our standards, we’ll make it right.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle removal of old concrete or pavers?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can remove and dispose of old concrete, pavers, or other hardscape and prep the site properly before a new installation. That includes clearing the area, addressing the base and drainage as needed, and leaving the site ready for the new work. You can ask for a removal quote when you request your free quote.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I maintain interlock?",
    answer:
      "Routine sweeping and occasional washing (e.g. with a pressure washer or gentle cleaner) keep the surface clean and reduce moss and stains. Over time, joints can lose sand or wear; we offer polymeric sand and resanding services to refill and stabilize joints, which also helps with weeds and ants. Sealing (e.g. natural or wet look) can protect and enhance the appearance—we can advise on timing and options.",
